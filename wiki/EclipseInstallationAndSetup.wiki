#summary This page describes from where to obtain a pre-packaged Eclipse and how we suggest to set up your workspace.

=Installing Eclipse=

A *pre-packaged Eclipse (for Linux platforms only)* can be obtained from [http://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/kdsl/eclipse-SDK-4.2-linux-gtk-ukp-20120727-x86_64.tar.bz2 the UKP public file server].
   * Download and install the latest pre-packaged version for your platform.
   * If you like, adapt the template script [http://dkpro-tutorials.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/files/start_eclipse.sh start_eclipse.sh], which configures your workspace, e.g., environment variables; this is not strictly necessary, however.

Currently supported platforms are:

   * Ubuntu Linux x86 64bit
   * Sun Java Development Kit 1.6 or !OpenJDK shipping with Ubuntu

The pre-packaged bundles are based on the Eclipse Classic distribution from http://www.eclipse.org which includes the Java Development Tools and the Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment. In addition at least the following plug-ins are also pre-installed

   * Version Control: Subclipse 1.8.x , see: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x
      * please do not use Subversive. Everybody in the group uses Subclipse and this is the only "supported" Subversion plugin at UKP.
   * Maven Integration: m2e , is included in Eclipse Classic. Use Help->Install New Software, select "--All available sites--" and choose Collaboration -> m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse
   * Subclipse/Maven Integration: Subclipse Maven Integration, update site: http://subclipse.tigris.org/m2eclipse/1.0/
   * Apache UIMA tools , see: http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/.
   * Task Management: Mylyn, is included in Eclipse Classic. Use Help->Install New Software, select "--All available sites--" and choose Collaboration -> Mylyn

Other plug-ins may also be included. A full list should be included in the README file accompanying the pre-packaged bundle.

=Eclipse Workspace Settings=

While the pre-packaged Eclipse ships with the most important plugins being installed, it is still necessary that you manually configure your workspace settings. This section guides you through this process.

==Code Style File==

For a uniform source code appearance everybody should install the following code style file. Install it in Eclipse via *Window/Preferences/Java/Code Style/Formatter/Import*.

   * [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/downloads/detail?name=DKProCoreStyle_20120326.xml DKPro Code Style]

Even though the formatting style is originally taken from the DKPro developers' resources, it reflects reasonable settings for other Java projects as well.

==Strongly Suggested Settings==

Everybody should make sure these the Eclipse workspace conforms to these settings.

|| *Setting* || *Value* || *Description* ||
|| *Window/Preferences/General/Workspace* || || ||
|| Text file encoding || UTF-8 || Encoding of all text files (including source files) ||
|| New text file line delimiter || Windows || Line ending used for all text files saved in Eclipse. When files are opened this setting has no effect since line-endings are transparently converted by Java ||
|| *Window/Preferences/General/Editors/Text Editors* || || ||
|| Display tab width || 4 || || 

==Further Useful Settings==

Furthermore, the following settings may be helpful.

|| *Setting* || *Value* || *Description* ||
|| *Window/Preferences/General/Editors/Text Editors* || || || 
|| Show print margin || on || Display a line indicating the recommended maximum line length ||
|| Print margin column || 100 || Lines should not be wider than 100 characters. ||
|| Show line numbers || on || Shows line numbers left in the editors. Helps navigating. ||
|| *Window/Preferences/UIMA Preferences* |||||| 
|| Automatically run !JCasGen when Types change || off || You may want to create types without JCas wrappers ||
|| *Window/Preferences/Java/Editor/Save Actions* ||||||
|| Additional actions || on || Perform additional actions when the file is saved ||
|| *Window/Preferences/Java/Editor/Save Actions/Additional actions/* ||||||
|| Add missing @Override annotations || on || Removes unnecessary warnings (Choose: _Configure/Missing Code_)||
|| Add missing @Deprecated annotations || on || Removes unnecessary warnings (Choose: _Configure/Missing Code_)||
|| Remove unused imports || on || Removes unnecessary warnings (Choose: _Configure/Unnecessary Code_) ||
|| Remove trailing whitespace || All lines || Code style (Choose: _Configure/Code Organization_)||
|| Use blocks in if/while/for/do statements || Always || Code style (Choose: _Configure/Code Style_)||
|| Convert for loops to enhanced for loops || on || Converts to =for(X x : listOfX)= - style loops if possible (Choose: _Configure/Code Style_) ||

==Better content assist==

Eclipse can automatically offer commonly used static methods via its content assist feature.
The settings for Content Assist may be found at *Windows/Preferences/Java/Editor/Content Assist/Favorites*.
The list below describes some basic imports which are frequently used in the context of UIMA. 
If you recognize that you often need static imports, you may enhance this list for your settings.

Add these types via the *New Type* button:

   * {{{org.uimafit.util.CasUtils}}} - commonly used methods for CAS access, e.g. {{{iterate}}}.
   * {{{de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.util.IOUtil}}} - in particular the {{{close()}}} method for closing streams
   * {{{org.uimafit.factory.AnalysisEngineFactory}}} - e.g. {{{createPrimitiveDescription()}}}
   * {{{org.uimafit.factory.CollectionReaderFactory}}} - e.g. {{{createDescription()}}}
   * {{{de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.util.ComponentFactory}}} - for {{{getDKProTypeSystem()}}}
