#summary This page describes how to create and manage single module Maven projects.

=Directory layout=
   * in the SVN create a folder _NICE_PROJECT_NAME_ with subfolders _trunk_, _tags_ and _branches_
   * the subfolders _trunk_ and _tags_ are important prerequisites for 
      * making a release with Maven
      * creating a tag in order to freeze a particular version of your experiment project

=Create a Maven Project=

In Eclipse, create a Maven project as described in the DKPro-Core First-Steps Tutorial on Google Code:
   * http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/MyFirstDKProProject#Create_a_project
   * http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/MyFirstDKProProject#Configure_the_POM
      * mind that the Dependency Management pane in Eclipse sometimes does not show artifacts when you try to add them, although they are in the Artifactory
      * in this case, you have to edit the _pom.xml_ source code and add the dependency manually, after looking it up in the Artifactory (e.g. on [https://zoidberg.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifactory/webapp/home.html zoidberg])

When you create a new UKP-internal or KDSL-internal Maven project, be sure to use the following *parent POM*, latest version:

<code language="xml">
<parent>

    <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.misc.superpom</artifactId>

    <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.misc</groupId>

    <version>...</version>

</parent>
</code>

=Check in your project=
Check in your newly created Maven project in the SVN under _NICE_PROJECT_NAME/trunk_, see also [CheckingInAProject].
