Copy some German example text documents (.txt format) into any folder of your choice (e.g., ~/dkpro) and adapt the parameters for the input and output paths in the !RunLinguisticAnnotationPipeline accordingly.

To check if your setup is ok, build the project.  Running the pipeline requires that you adapt the input and output paths according to your folder layout.


= Introduction to the Java Development Infrastructure =
You should work through this part of the tutorial on your own ("self-directed learning"). The best way to learn this content is by practicing (i.e. by doing). After working through the material listed below, you should be able to answer the following questions:
   * What are Maven artifacts and where are they stored?
   * Which Maven repositories do you know? What are the differences between them?
   * Committing a newly created Maven project to SVN: which folders and files should never be commited?
   * When should you create trunk/tags folders for your Maven project?
   * When to create a multi-module Maven project?
   * When to create a job in jenkins?
