#summary This page motivates the use of Maven's dependency management mechanism.

=Maven Dependency Management=

==Importing versions from a Maven Release==
   * If you have many dependencies from one release (e.g. dkpro.core) a change in the version number can result in a lot of work (i.e. changing the version number in all the dependencies)
   * Better way:
      * Add dkpro.core in "Dependency Management" Scope "Import" Type "Pom" with the version you want
      * Then you do not need to specify the version in all the dependencies that you import from that
      * If the version changes, you only have to change the version number there
