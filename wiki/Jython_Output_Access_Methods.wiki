== Introduction ==

uimaFIT supports several convenient methods to access the annotations added by the pipelines components. In the previous code examples we mainly used `select` to select all annotations of a certain types. In this tutorial we will introduce the different methods in a more structured way and will show some handy code examples.

Also please check the following site from the uimaFIT documentation: [https://uima.apache.org/d/uimafit-current/tools.uimafit.book.html#d5e218 uimaFIT Guide and References].


== Annotations and Type System ==
As mentioned in the introduction, UIMA uses the concept of annotations. Each information, for example the part-of-speech-tag for a word, is added as an annotation to the CAS (Common Analysis System). Different annotations are represented by different types, e.g. there are types for part-of-speech information, types for the lemma of word, types for named entity information and so on. Understanding which annotations with which types are added by a component is a crucial part for further using the results. For an overview of the type system used by DKPro, please see the following page in the main DKPro wiki: [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/TypeSystem DKPro Type System].

The following script runs some components like POS-tagging and NER and then prints *all* annotations that are added to the CAS.
