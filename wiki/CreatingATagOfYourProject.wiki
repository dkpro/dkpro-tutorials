#summary This page guides you through creating a tag of your project in SVN.

=Motivation=
Creating a tag (or even better: performing a Maven release) after you finished a set of scientific experiments (e.g. after submitting the publication where you describe these experiments) is a best practice, especially in research. This way, it is easier for you to reproduce your experiments, e.g. when you are working on a revision of your scientific publication.

=Preparation=

  * We assume that your project is located in a folder named _trunk_
  * On the same level as the _trunk_ folder, create a new folder _tags_ if it does not exist: Open the _SVN Repository Exploring_ perspective, right click on your project folder -> New -> New remote folder


=Creating a new Tag=
  * right click on your project folder (which is located in the _trunk_ folder) -> Branch/Tag -> select the target by browsing to the _tags_ folder and adding the name of a *new* subfolder like this: tags/NEW_SUBFOLDER 
  * then click _Next_ (HEAD revision) -> _Next_ -> enter comment -> _Finish_
